# LiTeFlowX

**LiTeFlowX** is a **Li**ghtweight **Te**nsor**Flow** e**X**tension library. It collects a bunch
of functions that can help you building and testing some complex neural network layers.

## DISCLAIMER

LiTeFlowX is not intended to be a super-layer like Keras
or Lasagne: it's just a collection of handy off-the-shelf code snippets that can
make us save some time when implementing some common operations. As soon as the 
official TensorFlow project will be provided with higher level APIs, thisl library 
will become useless -- I know, with such a cool name it's kind of a waste, but building
something more is way beyond the scope of my work and my abilities. Said that: have fun!
